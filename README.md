# VaxApp

## About

VaxApp is a web application consisting in an online reservation system for citizens aged 18 years and over who would like to receive their first COVID vaccination (1st or 2nd dose). The system keeps track of the doses received by each individual registered in the system. It also shows statistics about the profile of the individuals who received the vaccination, and provides a forum to ask questions about the vaccination campaign.
